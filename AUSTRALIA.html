    <h3>&nbsp;About Team Australia :</h3>
    <p>The Australia national cricket team represents Australia in men's international cricket. Along with England, it
        is the joint oldest team in Test cricket history, playing and winning the first ever Test match in 1877;[9] the
        team also plays One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket, participating in both the
        first ODI, against England in the 1970–71 season[10] and the first T20I, against New Zealand in the season,[11]
        winning both games. The team draws its players from teams playing in the Australian domestic competitions – the
        Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament and the Big Bash League. Australia
        are the current ICC World Test Championship and ICC Cricket World Cup champions. They are regarded as the most
        successful national team in the history of cricket.[12][13]

        The national team has played 872 Test matches, winning 418, losing 233, 219 drawn and with 2 tied[14] As of
        January 2025, Australia is first in the ICC Test Rankings.[15] Australia is the most successful team in Test
        cricket history, in terms of overall wins, win–loss ratio, and wins percentage. Australia have won the ICC World
        Test Championship once, defeating India in the final of the 2021–2023 World Test Championship.

        Test rivalries centre on The Ashes (with England), the Border–Gavaskar Trophy (with India), the Frank Worrell
        Trophy (with the West Indies), the Trans-Tasman Trophy (with New Zealand), and matches against South Africa.

        The team has played 1,008 ODI matches, winning 613, losing 352, tying 9 and with 34 ending in a no-result.[16]
        As of January 2025, Australia is ranked second in the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings.[17] Australia is one of the
        most successful teams in ODI cricket history, winning more than 60 per cent of their matches,[16] with a record
        eight World Cup final appearances (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015, and 2023) and have won the World
        Cup a record six times: 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015, and 2023. Australia is the first (and only) team to appear
        in four consecutive World Cup finals (1996, 1999, 2003, and 2007), surpassing the old record of three
        consecutive World Cup appearances by the West Indies (1975, 1979, and 1983) and the first and only team to win 3
        consecutive World Cups (1999, 2003, and 2007). The team was undefeated in 34 consecutive World Cup matches until
        the 2011 Cricket World Cup where Pakistan beat them by 4 wickets in the Group stage.[18] Australia is also the
        second team to win a World Cup (2015) on home soil, after India (2011). Australia have also won the ICC
        Champions Trophy twice (2006 and 2009) making them the first and the only team to be back to back winners in the
        Champions Trophy tournaments.</p><br>
