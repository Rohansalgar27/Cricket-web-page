    <h3>&nbsp;About Team India :</h3>
    <p>The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.[14] It was
        played and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat who were sea pirates and outlaws who often looted the British ships. The
        East India Company tried to manage the Kolis through cricket and were successful.[15][16][17] In 1848, the Parsi
        community in Mumbai formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After
        slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877.[18] By 1912, the Parsis,
        Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year.[18] In the
        early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and
        Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and
        Duleep Trophy two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by
        Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English
        county teams and not the England cricket team.</p>
