    <p1>Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian cricketer and the captain of India national cricket team
        in Test and ODI formats. Widely regarded as one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest
        opening batters of all time,[3] he is also regarded one of the greatest hitters in cricket history. He is a
        right-handed batsman who plays for India in international cricket, Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in
        domestic cricket. Rohit previously captained India in all three formats, and after leading the team to victory
        in 2024 T20 World Cup, he announced his retirement from T20Is.
        He holds several batting records which famously include most runs in T20 Internationals, most sixes in
        international cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and

        record of hitting fastest T20I century in 35 balls.[7] He also holds the world record for the highest individual
        score (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries
        in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he
        won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. He is the only player to win 50 matches as captain in
        T20Is.[8]
        He plays for Mumbai Indians and Mumbai cricket team in Indian Premier League (IPL) and domestic cricket
        respectively. He formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 Indian Premier League titles in 2013,
        2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under him, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record
        with MS Dhoni. With India, Rohit Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013
        ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. He is also one of two players who have
        played in every edition of the T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2024.[b]
