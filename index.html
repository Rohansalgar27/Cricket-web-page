    <h2>About Cricket :</h2>
    <p><b>Cricket</b> is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys
        bowled at a tree stump or the hurdle gate into a sheep pen.</p>
    <p><b>Cricket</b> a popular sport with a long history. It was invented in the 16th century in England, but it was a
        long time before modern rules were used.
        It is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while
        the
        other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a
        player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary, or by the two batting
        players running back-and-forth between the two wickets.The wickets are sets of three small, wooden posts that
        are at each end of a rectangle of short grass called 'the pitch', which is 22 yards long. The pitch is inside a
        much larger oval of grass called the 'area of play'. The area of play is a 30 yard circle inside the cricket
        ground or stadium. The fielding team can attempt to get batting players "out" in a number of ways. When a player
        is out, a teammate will replace them. When a team no longer has two "not-out" players left to score, then the
        other team gets the chance to bat.</p><br>

    <h2>Cricket Rules :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The rest of the batting team are off the field.</li>
        <li>Runs are got after a ball is bowled, mostly by hitting the ball and running, or by hitting the ball to or
            over the boundary.</li>
        <li>The bowler is trying to aim the ball at a wicket, which is made up of three sticks (called stumps) stuck
            into the earth, with two small sticks (called bails) balanced on them.</li>
        <li>The other fielders may chase the ball after the batsman has hit it.</li>
        <li>An over is six balls, meaning he bowls six times. Then another player becomes the bowler for the next over,
            and bowls from the other end, and so on. The same bowler cannot bowl two overs one after the other.</li>
